## üìú Overview

This repository contains a robust and scalable pipeline for extracting key-value information from invoices in PDF and image formats. The solution leverages the SOTA OCR-free vision-language model (Donut) alongside classical OCR fallback for maximum reliability and accuracy.

The notebook `MIP.ipynb` is fully annotated and Colab-ready, supporting single or multi-page documents, rapid extension to new fields, and efficient operation on GPU hardware.
